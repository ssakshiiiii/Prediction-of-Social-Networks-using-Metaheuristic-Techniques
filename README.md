The project's motivation lies in addressing the complexity and dynamic nature of influence networks by leveraging the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms.

The project aims to efficiently navigate large solution spaces, adapt to evolving network dynamics, and potentially uncover novel influence strategies that traditional methods might overlook. Ultimately, the goal is to contribute to the development of more effective and scalable approaches for influence maximization in diverse applications such as marketing, information spread, and understanding social network dynamics.We introduced a genetic algorithm, with competition among, and evolution of, populations to obtain solutions for IM problem. The GA can not only obtain better results but also improve the efficiency of the algorithm. From the experiments, we find that the performance of GA is similar to KGA and even better than other methods or algorithms.

Genetic algorithms use techniques such as crossover and mutation to explore different combinations of nodes in the solution space. This exploration helps in identifying diverse sets of influential nodes, which may be missed by other optimization techniques.

The choice between these algorithms may depend on factors such as the size and structure of the network, the availability of computational resources, and the specific optimization criteria.In our case where the dataset size is quite large GA performs significantly well than SA in terms of diversity and optimality and accuracy of solutions.
